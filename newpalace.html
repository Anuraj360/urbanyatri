      <h2>🏰 New Palace (Shahu Palace) – The Royal Heritage of Kolhapur</h2>
     <p><pre>

📍 Location

The New Palace, also known as Shahu Palace, is situated in the heart of 
Kolhapur city.
Surrounded by a sprawling 48-acre garden, it stands as a majestic reminder of 
the city’sroyal legacy.

🏛 Historical Significance

The palace was constructed between 1877 and 1884 during the reign of Chhatrapati 
Shahu Maharaj, one of the most progressive rulers of Kolhapur. Shahu Maharaj 
was known for his social reforms, patronage of education, and efforts toward 
equality, and the palace became not just his residence but also a symbol of
his visionary leadership. Today, it continues to be partly occupied by the royal
family while also serving as a museum of Maratha history.

🏗 Architecture

The New Palace is a masterpiece of Indo-Saracenic architecture, blending Hindu, 
Islamic, and European styles. Made of black polished stone, the palace has arched 
verandas, domes, and intricately carved columns. The central structure is surrounded 
by gardens, fountains, and a beautiful lake. Inside, visitors can explore 
the Durbar Hall, which has stained glass windows depicting episodes from the 
life of Shivaji Maharaj.

🖼 Museum & Collections

The palace houses the famous Shree Chhatrapati Shahu Museum, which displays rare 
collections of the Maratha legacy. Exhibits include royal costumes, jewelry, 
weapons, coins, silver artifacts, hunting trophies, and photographs of the royal 
family. A special highlight is the display of stuffed animals and hunting 
memorabilia, reflecting the lifestyle of the royalty in earlier times. The 
museum offers tourists a rare glimpse into the rich heritage and traditions 
of Kolhapur’s royalty.

🙏 Cultural Importance

Beyond its royal charm, the New Palace is also a cultural landmark, representing 
the glorious history of the Marathas and their role in shaping Maharashtra’s 
identity. It serves as a reminder of progressive social reforms introduced by 
Shahu Maharaj, including support for education and upliftment of marginalized 
communities.

photographer’s delight, with its grand architecture, royal interiors, and lush
