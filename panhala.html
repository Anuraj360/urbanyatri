      <h2>🏰 Panhala Fort – The Pride of Kolhapur</h2>
     <p><pre>

📍 Location

Panhala Fort is located about 20 kilometers from Kolhapur city in Maharashtra. 
Nestled at
an altitude of 845 meters, the fort offers breathtaking panoramic views of the 
Sahyadri mountain ranges, making it not just a historical site but also a scenic 
getaway. The fort is easily accessible by road transport—tourists can reach here 
convenientlyusing state transport buses, local taxis, or private vehicles. 
The journey itself is memorable as it passes through winding roads, lush 
greenery, and cool mountain air.

🏛 Historical Significance

Panhala Fort has a rich and layered history dating back to the 12th century, when 
it was built by the Shilahara dynasty. Over time, it witnessed expansions by the 
Yadavas of Devagiri and later came under the control of the Bahmani Sultans. 
However, its greatestimportance came during the 17th century, when Chhatrapati 
Shivaji Maharaj made it a strategic base. The fort is most famous for its association 
with the Battle of Pavan  khind (1660), where the brave warrior Baji Prabhu Deshpande 
sacrificed his life to ensure Shivaji Maharaj’s safe escape from the siege. For some 
time, Panhala even served as the capital of the Maratha Empire, marking its place in 
the golden chapters of Indian history.
  

🏗 Architecture

Spread across a 7 km perimeter, Panhala is one of the largest forts in the Deccan 
region. Its fortified walls, massive bastions, and hidden escape routes show how 
advanced the fort’s defense system was. Visitors can explore iconic structures 
like the Teen Darwaza (triple-arched gateway), the mysterious Andhar Bavadi 
(hidden well), the Sajja Kothi, and the grand Ambarkhana granaries. The fort’s 
natural defense is equally impressive—surrounded by steep slopes and dense forests, 
making it extremely difficult for enemies to conquer.

⚔ Historical Importance

Panhala was a stronghold of the Marathas and witnessed fierce battles against the 
Mughals and the Adilshahi forces. It holds a special place in Maratha history because 
Shivaji Maharaj spent over 500 days here, making it his longest stay at any fort. 
For the people of Maharashtra, Panhala is more than stone walls—it is a symbol of 
courage, sacrifice, and resilience.

🌄 Tourist Experience

Visiting Panhala is like walking back in time. Tourists can enjoy breathtaking views 
of Kolhapur and the Sahyadri hills, especially from the fort’s bastions. It is a 
paradise for trekkers, history lovers, and photographers, as the fort offers a blend 
of heritage and natural beauty. Heritage walks across the ruins bring the past alive, 
while the evening sunset views create a magical atmosphere.

🕕 Visiting Hours

The fort is open to visitors from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM, giving ample time for 
exploration. The best season to visit is between October and February, when the 
climate is pleasant and the surrounding hills are lush green.
