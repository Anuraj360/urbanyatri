      <h2>🛕 Mahalaxmi Temple, Kolhapur</h2>
        <p>
          <!-- Temple information goes here -->
        <pre>
 📍 Location

* Situated in the heart of Kolhapur city, Maharashtra.
* Well connected by road, rail, and nearby airports, making it accessible for tourists 
from all parts of India.


👑 Historical Significance

* The temple was originally built in the 7th century during the rule of the 
Chalukya dynasty.
* This makes it over 1300 years old, a living heritage site that has stood strong 
through several centuries.
* The temple has undergone renovations under the *Yadavas, Chhatrapati Shivaji 
Maharaj*, and later rulers of Kolhapur.
* It is mentioned in many ancient scriptures and has been a key center of devotion, 
art, and culture for centuries.


🏛 Architecture

* The temple is a fine example of Chalukyan architecture.
* Made of black stone with intricate carvings of gods, goddesses, animals, and 
mythological scenes.
* The main sanctum (Garbhagriha) houses the idol of Goddess Mahalaxmi.
* The *idol is about 3 feet tall, carved in black stone, and weighs nearly **40 
kilograms*.
* She is seen in a standing posture, adorned with ornaments, crown, and holding a 
mhalunga (lemon) in one hand, which is unique.
* The temple shikhara (tower) and mandap (pillared hall) showcase fine stone 
work that reflects the grandeur of medieval Indian craftsmanship.


🙏 Religious Importance

* The temple is considered one of the 51 Shakti Peethas, sacred shrines 
dedicated to Goddess Shakti.
* According to legend, when Goddess Sati’s body was dismembered, her eyes are 
believed to have fallen here.
* What makes this temple unique is that Goddess Mahalaxmi resides here with Lord 
Vishnu, unlike other Shakti Peethas where she is worshipped alone.
* Devotees believe that visiting the temple fulfills wishes of prosperity, health, 
and happiness.
* It is one of the six important pilgrimage sites in India collectively called 
Shakti Peethas of the Goddess.


🌞 Kiranotsav (Festival of Sun Rays)

* A very special celestial event celebrated twice every year, in *January and 
November*.
* During these days, the setting sun’s rays directly fall on the idol of 
Goddess Mahalaxmi, illuminating her face and body.
* This symbolizes the union of Surya (Sun God) and Ambabai (Mahalaxmi), 
believed to bring divine blessings to the devotees.
* Thousands of pilgrims and tourists visit during this time to witness the 
natural phenomenon and take part in special prayers.


🎉 Festivals

* Navratri Festival: Celebrated with grandeur for 9 days. The temple is 
decorated with lights and flowers, and cultural programs are organized.
* Diwali and Margashirsha Fridays: Special rituals and crowds of devotees.
* Kiranotsav: A unique highlight of the temple celebrated with great devotion.


🏛 Temple Complex

* The main temple of Goddess Mahalaxmi is surrounded by smaller shrines dedicated 
to Mahasaraswati, Mahakali, Lord Ganesh, and Shri Dattatreya.
* There is a sacred pond called Manikarnika Kund, where devotees perform holy 
rituals.
* The complex also has a large courtyard, pillared mandaps, and beautifully carved 
gateways.
* The architecture and spiritual atmosphere together make it not just a place of 
worship but also a center of art and history.


🕙 Visiting Hours

* Temple is usually open from 4:00 AM to 11:00 PM.
* Major daily rituals include *Kakad Aarti (early morning prayer), **Maha Aarti 
(midday prayer), and *Shej Aarti (night prayer before closing).
